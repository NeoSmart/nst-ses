nst-ses is a fork of the Amazon Simple Email Service developer tools,
developed and maintained by Mahmoud Al-Qudsi <mqudsi@neosmart.net> of
NeoSmart Technologies <http://neosmart.net/>

The original Amazon SES framework can be downloaded at

Improvements:

* All "From:" email addresses are converted to lower case. SES
verification of emails is case-sensitive, and multiple permutations of
the same email must be individually verified.

* Removes any email headers not supported by Amazon SES. These include
things like "Auto-Submitted" header (RFC 3834), which many webapps will
prepend to emails though it is not supported by Amazon SES. See
http://j.mp/SesHeaders for full list of supported headers.

* Removes any duplicate incoming headers. SES will error out if certain
keys are duplicated (e.g. Subject, MIME-Version, etc).

To-Do:

* Check if there are any email headers that *may* be safely duplicated
without triggering an SES error, instead of indiscriminately
de-duplicating everything.
